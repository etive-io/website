# Automating Projects with the Python API

## Overview

The new Python API in asimov 0.7.0 allows you to create and manage projects programmatically, making it easy to:
- Automate project setup in scripts
- Integrate asimov into larger workflows
- Batch create analyses
- Use asimov from within other Python applications

## Key Concepts

- Project context managers
- Programmatic event/analysis creation
- Ledger management
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

## Example Use Cases

1. Automated catalogue analysis setup
2. CI/CD integration for testing
3. Batch processing of gravitational wave events
4. Integration with data discovery tools

## Topics to Cover

- [ ] Creating projects programmatically
- [ ] Using context managers
- [ ] Adding events and analyses with Python
- [ ] Modifying project configurations
- [ ] Best practices for automation
- [ ] Error handling and validation
- [ ] Real-world example: Batch creating analyses for a catalogue
