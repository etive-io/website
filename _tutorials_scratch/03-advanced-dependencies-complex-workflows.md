# Building Complex Workflows with Advanced Dependencies

## Overview

The new flexible dependency system in asimov 0.7.0 allows sophisticated workflow orchestration with:
- Property-based filtering
- AND/OR/negation logic
- Staleness tracking
- Workflow graph integration

## Key Concepts

- Dependency specifications
- Property filters
- Logical operators
- Workflow graphs
- State machine handling

## Example Use Cases

1. Multi-event catalogue analyses with conditional steps
2. Hierarchical analyses with complex dependencies
3. Post-processing pipelines
4. Conditional re-runs based on previous results

## Topics to Cover

- [ ] Dependency syntax and specifications
- [ ] Property-based filtering
- [ ] Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- [ ] Staleness and re-running
- [ ] Visualizing dependency graphs
- [ ] Best practices for complex workflows
- [ ] Debugging dependency issues
- [ ] Real-world example: Multi-stage catalogue analysis
